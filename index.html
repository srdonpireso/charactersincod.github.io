                <h2>Donnie Walsh</h2>
                <p>"Born into a military family and raised in a tough neighborhood, Donnie Walsh grew up fearless and headstrong.</p>
                <p>
                Joining the army straight out of high school, Walsh is an infantry soldier through and through; the battlefield has become his second home.</p>
                <p>
                He is suspicious of covert ops and anything that operates outside of the established chain of command, viewing them as dishonorable. He prefers a straight-up fair fight, and knows that there's never a substitute for good boots on the ground.</p>
                <p>
                Now cybernetically augmented, he uses his unique abilities to rush headlong into the fray, meeting his enemies with sheer unadulterated and overwhelming force!".</p>

                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Next to nothing is revealed about Ruins' past from his transmissions. However in his transmissions he is shown to be very headstrong and confident. He shows great interest in sharing battle stories and seems to have a very good relationship with Battery.</p>
                <p>
                Ruin has a high amount of respect for those who fight with courage and who aren't afraid to go toe to toe with their enemies. He hates Spectre, often threatening them if they compromise the team. He seems to dislike Nomad but not nearly as much as Spectre.</p>
                <p>
                Ruin possess substantial augmentations, having both cybernetic arms and legs, the latter of which apparently possess high-power graphene super-capacitors. He also seems to have augmentations in his torso.
